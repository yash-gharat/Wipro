Question 8
Write a pseudo-code to find out if a given year is a leap year or not.
Any year which is divisible by 4 and not by 100 are leap years. Otherwise, any year which is divisible by 400 is also a leap year.

Algorithm

Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Input the year
Step 3 - If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or if the year is divisible by 400, then
Step 4 - Display "Leap year"
Step 5 - Else
Step 6 - Display "Not a leap year"
Step 7 - End

Pseudo-code

Start
Input year
if (year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100) or (year is divisible by 400) then  //if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0))
    Display "Is a Leap year"
else
    Display "Not a leap year"
End
