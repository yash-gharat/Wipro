Question 2
As a homework assignment, your teacher has given a flowchart (shown below) to find and display the square and cube of a positive number. The execution must be terminated, if a negative number is entered.

Algorithm:

Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Input a number (num)
Step 3 - If num is negative, then
Step 4 - Display "Execution terminated"
Step 5 - End
Step 6 - Calculate square of num (square = num * num)
Step 7 - Calculate cube of num (cube = num * num * num)
Step 8 - Display "Square of num is square"
Step 9 - Display "Cube of num is cube"
Step 10 - End

Pseudo-code

Start
Input num
if (num < 0) then
    Display "Execution terminated"
    End
square = num * num
cube = num * num * num
Display "Square of num is square" 
Display "Cube of num is cube"
End
