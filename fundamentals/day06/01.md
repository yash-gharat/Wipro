Q5 of 2outlined_flag
The following values are to be stored in a hash table (arriving in the order shown) using the hash function, h(k)= k%5.  

81, 20, 34, 42, 21, 45

Assume that the hash values are stored in ascending order.

Identify whether collision will occur while mapping the values using the hash function.
Options:
a. Collision will occur at position at 0,1
b. Collision will occur at position 0
c. Collision will occur at position 1
d. Collision will occur at position 3
e. No collision

OOP is a style of programming which allows us to club data and behavior together.
This is more suited for coding real life scenarios.
Objects are real world entities
Class is just a classification. It is just a concept.
Class is a description of attributes and behavior that objects of that classification should possess.
Attributes are created in a special function called __init__ and behaviors are created using functions called methods.
Objects can be created using ClassName() or using object literals for some of the built in classes
Attributes are created using reference_variable.attribute_name = value syntax.
Behavior is created by defining a function inside the class having a special parameter called self
