Question 5
 
Accept three numbers and check whether they are 'Pythagorean Triplets' or not. Display the message accordingly.
(Hint: Use Pythagoras Formula for a Right-angled Triangle: h = p2+b2)
 Algorithm

 Start
Input three numbers (a, b, c)
Calculate the squares of each number: a_squared = a * a, b_squared = b * b, c_squared = c * c
If (a_squared + b_squared = c_squared) or (a_squared + c_squared = b_squared) or (b_squared + c_squared = a_squared)
Display "The numbers are Pythagorean Triplets"
Else
Display "The numbers are not Pythagorean Triplets"
End

Start
Input a, b, c (3,4,5)
a_squared = a * a 9
b_squared = b * b 16
c_squared = c * c 25
If (a_squared + b_squared = c_squared) OR (a_squared + c_squared = b_squared) OR (b_squared + c_squared = a_squared) Then
    9+16=25 or 9+25=16 or 16+25=9
    T or F or F
    T
    Display "The numbers are Pythagorean Triplets"
Else
    Display "The numbers are not Pythagorean Triplets"
End If
