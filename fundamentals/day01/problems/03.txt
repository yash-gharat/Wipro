Question 3
Anuj, a class 9 student, has designed the following flowchart to input a positive number and check and display whether the number is a single digit number, a double digit number or a triple digit number. To assess his brother who is in class 8, he hides four statements in the flowchart.

Algorithm

Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Input a positive number (num)
        if num>0 then 
        Not a positive number
Step 3 - if num is less than 10, then
Step 4 - Display "Number is a single digit number"
Step 5 - else if num is less than 100, then
Step 6 - Display "Number is a double digit number"
Step 7 - else if num is less than 1000, then
Step 8 - Display "Number is a triple digit number"
Step 9 - else
Step 10 - Display "Number is greater than three digits"
Step 11 - End

Pseudo-code

Start
Input num
if num < 10 then
    Display "Number is a single digit number"
else if num < 100 then
    Display "Number is a double digit number"
else if num < 1000 then
    Display "Number is a triple digit number"
else
    Display "Number is greater than three digits"
End
