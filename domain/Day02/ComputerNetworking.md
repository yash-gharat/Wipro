### 2.0 Understanding Computer Networking

### 2.1 Introduction to Networking

**Basic Networking Concepts**:

- **Network**: A group of interconnected computers and devices.
- **Types of Networks**: LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), PAN (Personal Area Network).
- **Network Topologies**: Star, Ring, Bus, Mesh, Hybrid.
- **Networking Devices**: Routers, Switches, Hubs, Modems, Access Points.

**Importance in Software Development and Communication**:

- **Collaboration**: Enables communication and data sharing among developers and teams.
- **Resource Sharing**: Facilitates sharing of hardware (printers, storage) and software resources.
- **Distributed Computing**: Supports applications that run on multiple computers simultaneously.
- **Internet and Web Services**: Fundamental for developing and using web applications, cloud services, and APIs.

### 2.2 Network Models and Protocols

**OSI and TCP/IP Models**:

- **OSI Model**: A conceptual framework with seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) for understanding and designing a network system.
- **TCP/IP Model**: A more practical model with four layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application) that corresponds to real-world internet architecture.

**Common Protocols**:

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transmitting web pages over the internet.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides a faster, but less reliable, data transfer method than TCP.

### 2.3 IP Addressing and Subnets

**IPv4 vs. IPv6**:

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address scheme allowing for 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address scheme allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses, solving the shortage of IPv4 addresses.

**Subnetting Basics**:

- **Subnetting**: Dividing a network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.
- **Subnet Mask**: Used to determine which portion of an IP address is the network and which part is the host.

**Network Address Translation (NAT)**:

- **NAT**: A method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in IP packet headers.
- **Purpose**: Allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.

### 2.4 Wireless and Wired Networks

**Comparison of Wired and Wireless Networking**:

- **Wired Networks**: Uses cables (Ethernet) for connection; generally faster, more secure, and reliable.
- **Wireless Networks**: Uses radio waves (WiFi) for connection; more flexible and easier to set up, but potentially less secure and prone to interference.

**WiFi, Ethernet, and Emerging Technologies**:

- **WiFi (Wireless Fidelity)**: Common wireless networking technology using radio waves.
- **Ethernet**: Standard for wired networking, typically using twisted pair cables (Cat5e, Cat6).
- **Emerging Technologies**:
  - **5G**: Next-generation wireless technology offering higher speeds and lower latency.
  - **Li-Fi**: Uses light waves for data transmission, offering potentially faster speeds and increased security.

### 2.5 Network Security Basics

**Introduction to Network Security Challenges**:

- **Threats**: Malware, hacking, phishing, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Weak passwords, unpatched software, unsecured networks.

**Basic Security Measures**:

- **Firewalls**: Hardware or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**: Secure connections over the internet that encrypt data traffic and mask user IP addresses to enhance privacy and security.

### Summary

Understanding computer networking involves grasping basic concepts, network models, protocols, IP addressing, and security measures. Knowledge of networking is essential in software development and communication, enabling effective resource sharing and internet services. The comparison of wired and wireless networks helps in choosing the right setup, while network security basics are crucial for protecting data and ensuring secure communication.
